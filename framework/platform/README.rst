MicroEJ Platform Configuration Additions
========================================

This directory contains all required files to properly configure an empty MicroEJ Platform project connected to a third party C BSP (Board Support Package) project.

- The ``content`` directory contains files that must be installed in a MicroEJ Platform configuration directory (the directory that contains the ``.platform`` file).
  It can be automatically downloaded using the following command line:

  .. code-block:: console
   
     svn export --force https://github.com/MicroEJ/PlatformQualificationTools/trunk/framework/platform/content [path_to_platform_configuration_directory]

- The ``scripts`` directory contains ready to use console scripts templates to invoke the build and the run of 
  a MicroEJ Firmware using a third party C toolchain or IDE (IAR Embedded Workbench, Keil MDK-ARM, Espressif ESP-IDF toolchain, ...)

Please refer to `MicroEJ Platform creation documentation <https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/PlatformDeveloperGuide/platformCreation.html>`_ for usage and options.
