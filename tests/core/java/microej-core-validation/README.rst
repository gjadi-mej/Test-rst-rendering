MicroEJ Core Validation
=======================

Overview
--------

This project contains test cases aimed at validating the correct runtime execution 
of a MicroEJ Platform connected to a Board Support Package (BSP).
 
Tests are written as JUnit test cases, thus the main entry point is automatically generated by MicroEJ SDK.

Requirements
------------

-  MicroEJ SDK version ``5.1.0`` (included in MicroEJ SDK dist. ``19.05``).
-  MicroEJ Platform built from a MicroEJ Architecture version ``7.0.0`` or higher.

Usage
-----

In MicroEJ SDK,

-  Select ``Run > Run Configurations...``. A launcher named
   ``microej-core-validation`` should be available under
   ``MicroEJ Application``, run it to compile the MicroEJ Application.

-  Before linking the application against the MicroEJ Platform, add the
   following code in your BSP to test the FPU configuration:

.. code:: c

   #include "sni.h"
   jfloat Java_com_microej_MicroejCoreValidation_testFloat (jfloat a, jfloat b) {return a * b;}
   jdouble Java_com_microej_MicroejCoreValidation_testDouble (jdouble a, jdouble b) {return a * b;}

-  For a best result in the Java Round Robin test, disable all the C
   native tasks except the MicroEJ task.

-  Compile the MicroEJ Application.

-  Run the application on the desired MicroEJ Platform.

-  Once all the tests have passed successfully, MicroEJ Core is
   validated.
